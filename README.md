## Requirements:
Before you can run this app locally, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Youâ€™ll also need to install the required Python libraries.

### Steps to Run Locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   
   
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   Create a virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the Dependencies**:
   Use the following command to install the necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the App**:
   Now, youâ€™re ready to launch the app! Run the following command to start the Streamlit server:

   ```bash
   streamlit run TextReader.py
   ```

   This will open a new tab in your browser with the Text Reader app running locally.
